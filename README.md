### ⚓️ How curiosity about linemen started
Perhaps being a Fantasy Football player causes me to not pay all attention to QB & skill positions

Rather, I began to feel curious about linemen, especially in terms of pass rush & pass protection

### 🔬 What raised my interests in OL/DL evaluation
Such a curiosity further rose when I realized that Senior Bowl is a great place to discover OL/DL talent

I actually have some success in finding very solid OL/DL since 2023:

OL: Saints RT Taliese Fuaga, Cardinals RG Isaiah Adams

DL: Colts ED Laiatu Latu, Seahawks ED Derick Hall, Steelers DI Keeanu Benton

Hall, Benton and Adams were all Day 2 picks, but many of their advanced metrics are still among the top quadrant

Notes: RT = Right Tackle, RG = Right Guard, ED = Edge Defender, DI = Defensive Interior

### 🛡️ How about their PFF metrics so far

Latu, Hall and Benton are all good to great at pass rush win rate among their positions

Hall is even having an elite pressure rate among NFL EDs
